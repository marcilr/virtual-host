Virtual host configuration


The default apache configuration is configured with:

  apache2.conf:227
  # Include the virtual host configurations:
  IncludeOptional sites-enabled/*.conf

The sites-enabled/ directory only has the default:
  000-default.conf -> ../sites-available/000-default.conf

This is a great configuration since new virtual hosts can
easily be added to the sites-enabled/ directory.
